At Changer, we follow a great way of working. We reuse code as much as possible and leverage use of open source technologies. We also like to give back to the community by open sourcing our code. When we started out working on Android clients for our existing products, we decided to build an open source library. It has been a while we released the [Android Utilities library](https://github.com/changer/cmsplugin-twitter) out into the wild on Github. The repository itself contains the guide on "Getting Started"

Feel free to use, copy or contribute to our work.
